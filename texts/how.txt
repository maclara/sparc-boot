                        <p><a name="how"><strong>How does it work?</strong></a></p>

                        <p>At boot time, after hardware checks and device initialization are performed,
                        the PROM of a SPARC loads a boot block from a boot device such as a hard disk 
                        drive, CD-ROM, or a network card. 
                        This boot block is so short (512 Bytes) that a full featured boot loader will
                        not fit into this space, especially since file systems like ext2 reserve only
                        1024 Bytes for a boot block, while the partition table itself already takes up 
                        512 Bytes.</p>

                        <p>To overcome this lack of space, SILO consists of a collection of stage loaders,
                        as shown in the figure below:</p>
                        <a href="images/bootchart.png"><img src="images/smallbootchart.png" border="0" alt="silo boot flowchart" /></a>
                        <p>The first stage boot loader (<tt>/boot/first.b</tt>), written completely in 
                        assembly language, is used only to retrieve a second stage boot loader
                        (<tt>/boot/second.b</tt>).
                        This second stage boot loader loads the actual operating system. It 
                        understands file systems, allowing the parsing of the configuration file
                        and the handling of compressed files. It also provides a command-line
                        interface to interactively select entries from the configuration file, to
                        add boot parameters, or to load a path you entered on the SILO command 
                        line prompt. See <a href="usingsilo.html">Using SILO</a> for more information about
                        using the SILO prompt.</p>

                        <p>The program <tt>/sbin/silo</tt> is used to install the first stage loader by 
                        copying the right first stage loader into the boot block (unless the correct
                        first stage is already installed and the <tt>-f</tt> option is not used to 
                        force the installation).</p>

                        <p><tt>/sbin/silo</tt> then writes the block number of the first block of the 
                        second stage boot loader (usually <tt>/boot/second.b</tt>) into it, and then
                        records all the block numbers of <tt>second.b</tt> and the name and location 
                        of the configuration file into the second stage boot loader.</p>
                        <p>If the file <tt>old.b</tt> can't be found in the <tt>/boot</tt> directory, the
                        old boot loader will be copied there by <tt>/sbin/silo</tt>. </p>

                        <p>The configuration file <a href="config.html"><tt>/etc/silo.conf</tt></a> is 
                        parsed by the actual boot loader at boot time. 
                        This means that the <tt>/sbin/silo</tt> program must be run only if you 
                        install a new version of SILO or if you move the second stage 
                        boot loader on the disk. This is different from the LILO boot loader on the 
                        i386 platform where you must run LILO each time when you have installed new 
                        kernel images or operating systems.</p>
