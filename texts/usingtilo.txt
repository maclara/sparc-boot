                        <p>TILO, the Trivial Image LOader, is used for building a simple TFTP boot loader
                        which embodies several kernel images for different Sun
                        <a href="config.shtml#arch">architectures</a> and a ramdisk root image. The 
                        images are gzip-ped to minimize memory usage.</p>

                        <p>After starting the boot loader, the architecture is detected, the appropriate
                        kernel is unpacked and then the booting procedure is launched.</p>

                        <p>Please note that <tt>maketilo</tt> is an internal command used by the 
                        <tt>tilo</tt> script. There is no need to use it directly.</p>

                        <p>TILO is available with the <a href="index.shtml">SILO</a> package from
                        <a href="/~bcollins/www.sparc-boot.org/">http://www.sparc-boot.org/</a>.</p>

                        <p>The general form to use TILO is:</p>
                        <p class="syn30">tilo [-o output] &lt;ELF kernel images&gt; &lt;root image&gt;</p>
                        <p>where:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><p><tt>&lt;-o output&gt;</tt>
                              <br />is the name of the output file to write the TILO image to. If not 
                              specified, it will be named <tt>tftpboot.img</tt>.</p></li>
                           <li><p><tt>&lt;ELF kernel images&gt;</tt>
                              <br />is a list of either a single <tt>sun4cdm</tt> or <tt>sun4u</tt> 
                              image, or one of each, in ELF format.</p></li>
                           <li><p><tt>&lt;root image&gt;</tt>
                              <br />is the initial ramdisk image to append to the kernel image.  It 
                              could be compressed as well.</p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><a name="build"><strong>Building Images with TILO</strong></a></p>

                        <p>There are basically three steps to build a boot image:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>Prepare a kernel image for each supported architecture in uncompressed
                              ELF format. Currently TILO expects atleast one <tt>sun4u</tt> or
                              <tt>sun4cdm</tt> kernel. You can only supply one of each kind. It will 
                              be possible to add Sun4 support in the future as well.</li>
                          <li>Prepare a root image for the initial ramdisk. It can be compressed, or
                              raw. TILO will compress it when needed.</li>
                          <li>Run the "tilo" script with the following parameters:
                              <p class="syn30">tilo [-o output] &lt;ELF kernel images&gt; &lt;root image&gt;</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A boot image will be created which contains everything necessary to boot on
                        each included architecture.</p>
